# Project Name: The Shoe Company

## Description
This project focuses on "The Shoe Company", entailing the creation of a MySQL database and the development of the home page for an e-commerce website. The database design adheres to specific naming conventions, normalization, and establishes table relationships. The project includes the implementation of a dynamic front-end interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, specifically for the home page. The website's responsive design ensures an optimal user experience for browsing shoe products and basic interactions, with further functionalities planned for future development.

## Tasklists
- [x] Design the database structure and implement the database schema according to the design.
- [x] Populate the database with relevant data for testing and demonstration.
- [x] Implement a professional, clean, and marketable design for the website with complementary colors and easy-to-read content.
- [x] Ensure adherence to naming conventions and normalization principles in the database.

## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure you have a web server environment with PHP and MySQL installed.
2. Set up a MySQL database and import database file **"the_shoe_company.sql"**.
3. Clone this repository to your web server directory.
4. Configure the database connection details in **Models/Database.php** file. **(If your database has no password, modify the Database.php file by replacing password="root" to password="".)**
   
## Learning Curve
Throughout the course of this project, we acquired in-depth knowledge of proper database design principles, including naming conventions, normalization, and establishing table relationships. This project enhanced our understanding of maintaining data integrity and optimizing database performance through normalization. We also developed our skills in front-end web development, including the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, to create dynamic and responsive web pages.

## Challenges
- Ensuring consistent adherence to naming conventions throughout the entire database schema posed a significant challenge initially. However, maintaining a strict focus on the naming conventions helped us to overcome this obstacle effectively.
- Understanding the intricacies of normalization and applying them effectively to the database schema and web design required comprehensive research and practical application. Overcoming these challenges allowed us to create a more optimized and efficient database structure and a seamless, user-friendly website interface.
